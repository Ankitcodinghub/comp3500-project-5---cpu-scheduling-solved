<h1>1. Learning Objectives</h1>
The goal of this project is to implement a simple CPU schedule, which orchestrates three CPU scheduling policies. You will achieve the following objectives upon the completion of the project.

<ul>
<li>To design a simple CPU scheduler</li>
<li>To implement three scheduling policies in C/C++</li>
<li>To conduct scheduling simulation experiments on a Linux machine</li>
<li>Use GDB to debug your C/C++ program</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h1>2. Requirements</h1>
You will implement a CPU scheduler that selects a job according to a given scheduling policy. Because the project intends to simulate a CPU scheduler, there is no need for any actual process creation, execution, or termination. When a task is scheduled, the simulator simply prints out what task is picked to run at a time. The outputs of your scheduler are similar to the Gantt chart style.

<ul>
<li>Each student should independently accomplish this project assignment. You may discuss with other students to solve the coding problems. Students should not share any project code with any other student. Collaborations among students in any form will be treated as a serious violation of the University‚Äôs academic integrity code.</li>
<li>Important! You must follow the specified output format.</li>
<li>You must write a C/C++ program on the Linux operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3. Implementing a CPU Scheduler</h1>
<h2>3.1 Scheduling Policies</h2>
Your simulator should manage the following three scheduling policies. The detailed algorithms will be introduced and discussed in COMP 3500 lectures.

<ul>
<li>First Come First Serve (FCFS),</li>
<li>Round Robin or RR, and</li>
<li>Shortest Remaining Time First or SRTF).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.2 Task Information and an Input File</h2>
The task information will be read from an input text file, the format of which is

pid arrival_time burst_time

All of fields are integer type where

<ul>
<li>pid is a unique numeric process ID</li>
<li>arrival_time is the time instance at which a task arrives</li>
<li>burst_time is the CPU time requested by a task</li>
</ul>
The time unit of arrival_time, burst_time, and interval is millisecond.

<h2>3.3 Command-line Usage</h2>
Users should run your scheduler in a command-line as:

$scheduler task_list_file [FCFS|RR|SRTF] [time_quantum]

where input_file is the file name with task information described in Section 3.2 on page 1. FCFS, RR, and SRTF are names of the scheduling policies (a.k.a., algorithms). Parameter time_quantum is only applicable to the RR policy. The FCFS policy is nonpreemptive whereas RR and SRTF are all preemptive. Table below summarize three example usages.

&nbsp;

<table width="606">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="198"><strong>Sample Usage </strong></td>
<td width="408"><strong>Description </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="198">scheduler list1 FCFC</td>
<td width="408">Simulate the FCFS policy with a task file named ‚Äúinput1‚Äù</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="198">scheduler list2 RR 5</td>
<td width="408">Simulate RR with the ‚Äúinput2‚Äù task file; time quantum is set to 5.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="198">scheduler list3 SRTF</td>
<td width="408">Simulate the SRTF policy with a task file named ‚Äúinput3‚Äù</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<h2>3.4 System Design</h2>
<strong>Data Flow Diagram.</strong> You are suggested to start the design of your scheduler by crafting a data flow diagram, which enables you to decide what modules should be implemented and what are correlations among these modules. With the data flow diagram in place, you are expected to have a clear picture on key data structures used in your scheduler. In the data-flow-diagram design phase, please ignore any issue related to algorithm design (e.g., time-driven simulation, scheduling policies).

<strong>Loading Input File.</strong> After the simulator reads a task information list from an input text file, all the task information should be stored in a task list (e.g., an array, a dynamic array, or a linked list). Then, the simulator schedules tasks according to a scheduling policy specified in the command-line.

<strong>Time-Driven Simulation.</strong> Your simulator manages tasks in a time-driven manner. More specifically, at each time unit (a.k.a., time slot), your simulator inserts any newly arrived task into the ready queue, followed by invoking the scheduler to choose an appropriate task from the ready queue. When a task is elected to run, the simulator prints out a message indicating the process ID of a task running in this time slot. If no task is running (i.e., the ready queue is empty) during the current time unit, the simulator prints out an ‚Äúidle‚Äù message. Before advancing to the next time unit, the simulator should update all necessary changes in the running task and the ready queue status.

&nbsp;

<h2>3.5 Output and Statistical Information</h2>
Your simulator will be applied to compare the performance among the three scheduling policies. The scheduler is expected to compute the following statistical information referred to performance metrics. You will learn these metrics in our lectures. Please refer to Section 6 on page 4 for a sample output.

<ul>
<li>average waiting time</li>
<li>average response time</li>
<li>average turnaround time</li>
<li>overall CPU usage</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.6 Suggested Functions</h2>
You are recommended to implement the following functions.

<ul>
<li><strong>A command-line parser.</strong> Please refer to the command-line parser in os161 as an example.</li>
<li><strong>Three scheduling algorithms.</strong> Each scheduling policy should be implemented in a dedicated function.</li>
<li><strong>Read an input file.</strong> This function is responsible for loading a task information list from an input file into your simulator.</li>
<li><strong>Print statistic information. </strong>All the performance measures (e.g., average waiting time) must be displayed upon the completion of a simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Error handler. </strong>If an input command doesn‚Äôt follow the specified format, the error handler must handle all types of input errors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>4. Programming Requirements</h1>
<h2>4.1 Programming Environment</h2>
Write your simulated virtual memory system in either C or C++.&nbsp; Compile and run your system using the gcc or g++ compiler on a Linux box (either in the computer labs in Shelby, your home Linux machine, a Linux box on a virtual machine, or using an emulator like Cygwin).

&nbsp;

<h2>4.2 Function-Oriented Approach</h2>
You are <em>strongly suggested</em> to use a structure-oriented (a.k.a., function-oriented) approach for this project. In other words, you will need to write function definitions and use those functions; you can‚Äôt just throw everything in the main() function. A well-done implementation will produce a number of robust functions, many of which may be useful for future programs in this project and beyond.

Remember good design practices include:

<ul>
<li>A function should do one thing, and do it well</li>
<li>Functions should NOT be highly coupled</li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h2>4.3 File Names</h2>
You will lose points if you do not use the specific program file name, or do not have a comment block on every source code file you hand in.

&nbsp;

<h2>4.4 Usability Concerns and Error-Checking</h2>
You should appropriately prompt your user and assume that they only have basic knowledge of the system. You should provide enough error-checking that a moderately informed user will not crash your system.&nbsp; This should be discovered through your unit-testing.&nbsp; Your prompts should still inform the user of what is expected of them, even if you have error-checking in place.

&nbsp;

<h1>5. Separate Compilation</h1>
You must use separate compilation and create a makefile for this project.

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>5.1 What‚Äôs Make?&nbsp; </strong>

Make is a program that looks for a file called ‚Äúmakefile‚Äù or ‚ÄúMakefile‚Äù, within the makefile are variables and things called dependencies. There are many things you can do with makefiles, if all you‚Äôve ever done with makefiles is compile C or C++ then you are missing out. Pretty much anything that needs to be compiled (postscript, java, Fortran), can utilize makefiles.

<h2>5.2 Format of Makefiles ‚Äî Variables</h2>
First, lets talk about the simpler of the two ideas in makefiles, variables. Variable definitions are in the following format:

VARNAME = Value

So let‚Äôs say I want to use a variable to set what compiler I‚Äôm going to use. This is helpful b/c you may want to switch from cc to gcc or to g++. We would have the following line in our makefile

CC = gcc

This assigns the variable CC to the string ‚Äúgcc‚Äù. To expand variables, use the following form:

${VARNAME}

So to expand our CC variable we would say:

${CC}

<em>&nbsp;</em>

<h2>5.3 Format of Makefiles ‚Äî Dependencies</h2>
Dependencies are the heart of makefiles. Without them nothing would work. Dependencies have the following form:

dependecy1: dependencyA dependencyB ‚Ä¶ dependencyN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command for dependency1

Check out the following links for more information on makefiles:

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html </a>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>6. Sample Input and Output</h1>
Suppose an input task file is called ‚Äútask.list‚Äù, your scheduler should run as follows to simulate the three scheduling policies.

&nbsp;

%more task.list

<ul>
<li>0 10</li>
<li>0 9</li>
<li>3 5</li>
<li>7 4</li>
<li>10 6</li>
<li>10 7</li>
</ul>
